# Pytorch-Intro
A long and comprehensive Introduction into the world of PyTorch for Deep Learning and Machine Learning


**File Pytorch Intro*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is just a simple introduction into tensors using PyTorch as well as Numpy. The code shows a bunch of tensors that have been manipulated as well as some arrays and matrix multiplication methods that are fundamental in the learning of Maching/Deep Learning. Code portraying things such as:
  - tensors - a way to represent data
  - scalar
  - matrix
  - tensor
  - creating a random tensor
  - create random tensor with similar shape to image tensor
  - tensor datatypes
  - Manipulating Tensors
  - Matrix Multiplication aka dot product
  - Reshaping Tensors (add dimensions, subtract (squeeze))
  - torch.permute - rearranges the dimensions of a target tensor in specified order (used in images)
  - reproductability (taking the random out of random) start with random numbers-> tensor operations -> update random numbers to try and make them better representations of the data (repeat)
